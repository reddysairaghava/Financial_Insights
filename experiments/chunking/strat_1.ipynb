      "product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \n",

      "significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \n",
      "with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \n",
      "and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \n",
      "prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \n",
      "at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \n",
      "free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \n",
      "as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \n",
      "solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\n",
      "**Supply of Components**\n",
      "Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \n",
      "components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \n",
      "other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \n",
      "components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \n",
      "shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n",
      "The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \n",
      "the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \n",
      "technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \n",
      "increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \n",
      "concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\n",
      "The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \n",
      "Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\n",
      "Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \n",
      "Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\n",
      "**Research and Development**\n",
      "Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \n",
      "ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \n",
      "services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \n",
      "products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \n",

      "accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \n",
      "property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \n",
      "property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \n",
      "the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\n",
      "The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \n",
      "development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \n",
      "Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \n",
      "intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \n",
      "duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\n",
      "In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \n",
      "intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \n",
      "aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \n",
      "licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \n",
      "on reasonable terms or at all.\n",
      "Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3\n",
      "**Business Seasonality and Product Introductions**\n",
      "The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \n",
      "part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \n",
      "sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \n",
      "distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \n",
      "older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \n",
      "distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n",
      "**Human Capital**\n",
      "The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive \n",

      "**Revenue Recognition**\n",
      "Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue \n",
      "at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is \n",
      "generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of \n",
      "ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control \n",

      "When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \n",
      "established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \n",
      "were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \n",

      "right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \n",
